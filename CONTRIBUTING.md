## Git Workflow

We have adopted the [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/), with some deviations:
- We have one long living branches: **dev**.
- **dev**â€™s HEAD should be ready for production.
- For following changes, we create a branches from **dev**, where `name` is the code of the issue in our issue management system:
    - **feature/name**
    - **bugfix/name**
    - **deprecation/name**
- Before creating the merge request, the developer should make sure the branch is up-to-date with the target branch. Don't **rebase** if you have already pushed your branch to the remote.
- Squash commits when merging feature branches to **dev**
- No one is allowed to push code directly to **dev**. We always create merge requests.
- Merge requests must be reviewed by at least two team members.
- Merge requests could be merged if only there are two approves.

## Updating Changelog
Updates from every merge request are to be added to the [changelog file] under ```Unreleased``` section. This must be done in accordance with [Keep A Changelog] convention under one of ```Added```, ```Changed```, ```Deprecated```, ```Removed```, ```Fixed```, ```Security``` types and be reviewed as a part of the changes on the merge requests.

[changelog file]: ./CHANGELOG.md
[Keep A Changelog]: https://keepachangelog.com/

## Semantic Versioning
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

1. MAJOR version when you make very noticeable or fundamental changes such as upgrading core libraries or architecture changes,
1. MINOR version when you make breaking changes such as changing functionality without backwards compatibility or adding new components, and
1. PATCH version when you add functionality or make bug fixes in a **backwards compatible manner**.
